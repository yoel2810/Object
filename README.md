In order to catch the pokemons I want to first set the agents at the best 
locations. In order to do that I find the most valuable pokemons and set the 
agents locations to the start of the edge of where the pokemon is.
When I located all the agents I set their targets to their closest pokemon and 
build the shoertest path by using dijkstra algorithm.
